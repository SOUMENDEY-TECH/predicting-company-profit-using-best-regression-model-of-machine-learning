# predicting-company-profit-using-best-regression-model-of-machine-learning
In the given dataset, R&D Spend, Administration Cost and Marketing Spend of 50 Companies are given along with the profit earned. The target is to prepare an ML model which can predict the profit value of a company if the value of its R&D Spend, Administration Cost and Marketing Spend are given

i) Construct Different Regression algorithms
ii) Divide the data into train set and test set
iii) Calculate different regression metrics
iv) Choose the best model
